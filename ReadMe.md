Coco/R (http://ssw.jku.at/coco/) is a compiler generator, which takes an attributed grammar of a source language and generates a scanner and a parser for this language. The scanner works as a deterministic finite automaton. The parser uses recursive descent. `LL(1)` conflicts can be resolved by a multi-symbol lookahead or by semantic checks. Thus the class of accepted grammars is `LL(k)` for an arbitrary `k`.

There is **a version** of `Coco/R` for Python language called `CocoPy`.

This is a fork of CocoPy-1.1.0rc (https://pypi.org/pypi/CocoPy/) by Ronald Longo, since it is unmaintained.

This is vastly improved beyond the original state. See the `git log` and `changelog.json` for more details.

Mostly:

* usage via API is available (but be careful, **this shit is GPLed**ðŸ’€ and I am not in power to change that, blame the original authors for that);
* runtime and generated code are separated (the runtime is also GPLed (its code is derived from frame files that were GPLed), but Coco/py license says `If not otherwise stated, any source code generated by Coco/R (other than Coco/R itself) does not fall under the GNU General Public License.`);
* frame files are eliminated in favour of object oriented programming as a more saner, cleaner and code-safe way;
* correct processing of inline python code (now this shit can generate itself!);
* some optimizations in generated code;
* sorce code is typed;
* legacy versions of python have been dropped.
