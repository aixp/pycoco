Notes:

If you would like to bootstrap coco (have coco generate itself) you can
do the following.

   1.  Copy the following files into a new folder:
            Coco app files:
               Coco.py
               Parser.py
               Scanner.py
               CharClass.py
               CodeGenerator.py
               Core.py
               DriverGen.py
               Errors.py
               ParserGen.py
               Trace.py
            Target language (coco) source files:
               Coco.atg
               Coco.frame
               Parser.frame
               Scanner.frame
        This step is precautionary so you don't accidentally overwrite
        something.

   2.   Open a command prompt and 'cd' into this new folder.

   3.   type:

           python Coco.py -acfgijmnpsx Coco.atg

   4.   Asside from the .pyc files generated for each of the app files,
        Coco.py will generate the following output files:

           Newly generated Coco app files:
              Coco-test.py
              Parser-test.py
              Scanner-test.py

           Misc. output files:
              listing.txt
              trace.txt

   5.   Use a diff utility to compare:
              Coco-test.py to Coco.py
              Parser-test.py to Parser.py
              Scanner-test.py to Scanner.py

        you can also use python's diff:
           e.g. python c:\Python25\Tools\Scripts\diff.py Coco-test.py Coco.py

        In all three cases the files should be identical.

   6.   It is now safe to remove the three old files and rename the
   -test.py files.
