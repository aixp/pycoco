Setup
-----

Pimaker is written in Coco as a practical example of a Coco application.

To setup pimaker it must furst be compiled by coco as follows:

      > python ../Coco.py -c pimaker.atg

This will generate pimaker.py, Pimaker's main module.


Using
-----

Pimaker reads in a file that is very much like a makefile.  It then
identifies the top-level targets (those upon which no other rules depend)
and from them constructs a menu of targets.  Below the menu is a prompt.

If the user types the name of a target, then that target will be built.

If the user types 'showall', then all targets (top-level and not) will be
lsited.

If the user types 'exit', then pimaker will exit.


makepi.how files
----------------

When pimaker first launches, it will search for and parse the file
named makepi.how.  This file is much like a makefile.  It contains some
initial code followed by rules for building named targets.  All code is
written in Python.

A build rule has the following syntax:

      'target:' target1 target2 ...
      'needs:'  dependency1 dependency2 ...
      'todo:'   pythonCode
                '$$$'

      or

      'target:' target ( description of target )
      'needs:'  dependency1 dependency2 ...
      'todo:'   pythonCode
                '$$$'

Note that targets are separated by spaces and are not enclosed in quotes.

The first form actually specifies a group of targets all of which are built
from the same dependancies using the same Python code.  Internally, pimaker
will generate one rule for each target provided.

The second form specifies a single target with some commentary in parenthesis.
If this is a top-level target, then this commentary will appear beside the
target name in the generated menu.

All paths specified in 'target:' and 'needs:' should be specified using
the UNIX convention where '/' separates directories.  Pimaker will convert
these paths to platform specific forms before making use of them.

MACROS

Pimaker also has a limited macro capability.  Macros may be used in a
dependency or in the todo section of the rule.  A macro takes the following
form.

   '${' MacroName [ '.' ElementSelector ] { ',' Mutation } '}'

MacroName can be any python global variable.  Generatlly you will want to
limit this to something declaired in the initialization section of the
makepi.how file, or one of the 'special' variable names.  Any variable
used for MacroName must expand into a string or python sequence of strings.

If element selector is specified, it selects only a portion of the value
specified by MacroName.  Currently, the only elements possible are for
cases where MacroName expands into a filename path.  

   dir    - the directory in which the named file exists.
   name   - the filename without the path.
   ext    - the extension portion of the filename.
   base   - the filename without the path or extension.

   In future implementations, additional elements may be possible.

Mutation specifies a mutation on the value selected by
MacroName.ElementSelector.  The following mutations are currently supported.

   findSubstring '=' replaceValue
      Having selected string, this mutation changes findSubstring into
      replacevalue.

Special Variables

   TARGET - the target string for this rule.
   NEEDS  - the list of dependencies.







Examples


   TARGET = '/home/myProject/myFile.py'


   ${TARGET}                 expands to:   '/home/myProject/myFile.py'
   ${TARGET.dir}             expands to:   '/home/myProject'
   ${TARGET.name}            expands to:   'myFile.py'
   ${TARGET.ext}             expands to:   'py'
   ${TARGET.base}            expands to:   'myFile'

   ${TARGET.base}.atg        expands to:   'myFile.atg'
   ${TARGET.name,py=atg}     expands to:   'myFile.atg'
